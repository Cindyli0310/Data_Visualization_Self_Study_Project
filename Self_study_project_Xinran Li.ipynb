    "By doing an literature search on effectiveness visualization, I learned many new criteria to evaluate an effective graph. For example, graph intergrity is so important,because any underestimate or overblown will lead a mistake to audience. On the other hand, I never think about accessibility problems before. After I read \"accessible data viz is better data viz\" by Cole, I realized that creating an effective visualization needs to concerns many areas. For instance, an alt webpage image can help disability people to read paper. Moreover, constrast color can help color blindess people to have a better understanding of graphs.\n",
